        "1": "Leopold Freiherr Popper von Podhrágy was born on 15 February in Bytča, Slovakia. <br/> As one of the first Austrian entrepreneurs, he was engaged in the logging business in Halychyna and Hungary, laying the foundation for his huge commercial success. He was one of the richest landlords of Austria-Hungary. In 1869 he was granted the title of the Hungarian nobility and in 1882 - the Austrian nobility. <br/> In the 1860s and 1870s, he started to sell wholesale wood from Hliník (Bytča). It was used for the building and extension of the Hungarian railway. It also supplied wood for building the Suez Canal and played an important role in the manufacturing of building materials and wood in Europe.",
        "2": "In 1873 Popper’s company established the first group out of 18 sawmills, in particular, the Evelina Steam Sawmill in Vyhoda and a water sawmill in Staryi Mizun. In the 70s and 80s of the 21st century, the Evelina Sawmill became the biggest enterprise of this kind in Halychyna. <br/> In 1883 in order to increase wood exports the Baron built a railway branch from the city of Dolyna to the Evelina Steam Sawmill. The new railway station <br/> and the post office were officially called Vyhoda. The name was later applied to the settlement which appeared around the station. Leopold Popper von Podhrágy died on 2 March in 1886 in Sanremo, Italy. He was buried at the cemetery in the village of Hliník over the Váh River",

He studied law and humanities at the universities of Vienna, Budapest and Heidelberg. In 1885 he received a doctorate degree.<br/> After the death of Leopold Popper he continued his father’s legacy, developing the logging and process industries.<br/> In 1890 his company laid a narrow gauge railway track which connected the steam sawmillin Vyhoda with the water sawmill in Staryi Mizun.<br/> Armin Hermann Popper von Podhrágy died in 1924",

      "theOldestNarrowGaugeRailway": {
        "1": "The oldest narrow gauge railway in the Carpathians was laid by Baron Armin Popper’s company in 1890. It spread only over three kilometers from the steam sawmill in Vyhoda to the water sawmill in Staryi Mizun. This railway worked using horse traction - logs were loaded onto platforms which were drawn on rails by horses. The building of such a narrow gauge railway resulted from economic factors because it was cheaper than the usual one. The width of the railway was 750 mm. Through time, the manufacturing of steam trains, which were used for narrow gauge railways, changed from horse traction to steam.",
        "2": "In 1913 after the long process of project development, approvements and value assessment the building of the narrow gauge railway along the Svicha River from Vyhoda to the settlement of Liudvykivka near the village of Myslivka started. It was constructed by a German company called Orenstein & Koppel. However, World War I interrupted the process. The restoration and further development of the narrow gauge railway started after the fall of the Austrian Empire and the establishment of power of the Polish Rzeczpospolita in 1918. The sudden death of Baron Armin Popper in 1924 halted building for a short time. However, later, his company was transferred to the British company called Silvinia Land und Forstwirtschaft, Wygoda, which continued the extension of the narrow gauge railway and its infrastructure. By 1939 the total length of the railway was 65 kilometers. There were routes from Vyhoda to Solotvynskyi (along the River Mizunka) and Beskydskyi (along the River Svicha) Mindunok1.",
        "3": "After World War II the two narrow gauge railways were combined into one and the active building of the branches was started. The railway length reached 170 km.<br/>In the 1970s and 1980s, the logging volumes decreased, and the railway started to fall into decline. At the beginning of 1990, the railway length was 135 km.<br/>In 2000 the Uniplyt Woodworking Enterprise restored the Mizun branch of the narrow gauge railway which is still functioning today. Besides its main aim - wood transportation - the narrow gauge railway is used as a tourist attraction called the Carpathian Tram. The total length of the railway with its branches is 58 km, but only the first 15 km is used for tourist trips.",
