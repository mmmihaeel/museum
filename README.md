# Museum Presentation Next.js Application

This is a Next.js 13+ application for a museum presentation. It includes
TypeScript source files, localization dictionaries for i18n, library JavaScript
scripts, and public assets.

## Directory Structure

- `app`: Contains TypeScript source files for the application.
- `dictionaries`: Contains localization dictionaries for i18n.
- `lib`: Includes JavaScript library scripts.
- `public`: Houses public assets like images, styles, and fonts.

## Build and Run

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Building the Application

To build the application and create a minimized production-ready version, run
the following command:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with
[`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses
[`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to
automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
